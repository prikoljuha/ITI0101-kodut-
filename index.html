<h2>Fact about monkeys</h2>
<h3>They Use Grooming to Strengthen Relationships</h3>
<p>For monkeys, picking bugs, dirt, and other debris off their companions is far from an indictment of their personal hygiene it's an expression of affection and love. Grooming rituals not only keep monkeys healthy, they also strengthen their social bonds and, ultimately, make them feel more comfortable. Researchers have discovered that when vervet monkeys comb each others pelts, it fluffs the fur and makes it thicker. After a thorough grooming, the insulation value of the vervet monkeys pelt increases by as much as 50%.</p>
